**-->> 📁 Dataset**

- ""Source"": LendingClub public dataset (Downloaded from Kaggle / official source)
- ""Rows"": Aprrox 37,000+
- ""Columns"": 100+ (various financial & personal borrower details)

**-->> 📊 Objective**

- Analyze the structure of LendingClub loan data.
- Identify factors that influence loan status (Fully Paid, Charged Off,Current Status (Ignored In Data-Analysis Cause We Can't Predict Applicants Behaviour)).
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
- Derive business Insights/Recomendations that can help in credit risk assessment.

**-->> 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used**

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis

**-->> 📌 Key Steps Performed In EDA Analysis**

1. ""Data Cleaning""
   - Handling missing values
   - Dropping irrelevant or redundant columns
   - Formatting and type conversion

2. ""Univariate Analysis""
   - Distributions of loan amount, interest rates, term, grades

3. ""Bivariate Analysis""
   - Loan status vs interest rate, loan purpose, etc.

4. ""Multivariate Analysis""
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Factors affecting loan defaults

5. ""Insights & Conclusions""
   - Summarized key findings with visual charts
   - Business recommendations

## ✅ Final Takeaways

- High interest rates and sort terms increase the chances of default.
- Debt-Consolidation loan purposes are riskier than others.
- Grades and subgrades strongly correlate with loan risk.
